SIDS was a project I dropped on twitter around end of april, and actively worked on
for some time.
Me being a single mad man, and an unexprienced twitter social user,
you can imagine how it went.

alongside I opend jester_nutrak and tried to see wats this CT is all about.
brainrot indeed.

but anyways...

let me school you a bit on SIDS LOGOS.

at the time, early 2024, i was in the atomicals bitwork trenches.
i fell in love with the idea of bitwork.
and worked slowly on a bitwork based collection.
as chance would have it. scene was kinda dead.
i stashed the collection in the drawer.

woke up one day, seeing non fungible runes being minted.
lo and behold... SIDS was born and minted in 3 days. 
imagine my surprise.

and here we are today.

so, wat was it all about u ask?

SIDS LOGOS was an attempt to:

1. overide the brainrot narrative.  

( i felt i personally peaked with hpos10i q4 2021.  
  i was one of the pioneers, in regard to brainrot, 
  and needed to tackle a deeper challenge )

	Provide some remembrance of how satoshi's Bitcoin fits in the bigger puzzle of our lives.
	And to me, the phrase "soveriegn individual", is the banner called for. 
	Along side the trivium and quadrium, which to me represent our core human treasures.


2. keep it true to the degen shitposting spirit

	no obligation to no one
	public fair mint
	no social harvesting
	ugly art

3. visually dethrone the CryptoPunks narrative 

	"the rulling visual narrative - face on the right side of the neck,
	must be broken!" , I heard the voices say.

	CryptoPunks can never truly represent the 
	cypherpunks ideal, nor the soverign individual's one. 
	Due to the simple fact they be not on motherchain.
	I wanted for motherchain to have something that stands for it's own. 
	Something that will be a complete contrast to the altcrypto fiatlike world.
	So the necks were broken,
	  and somehow SIDS minted out.

4. push the envelope in regard to minimalism, and our understanding of pfps
	
	i have meditated upon the collection.
	i have worked on it.
	the doplphin is a work of art.
	but who am i to judge my own work, right?


and then along the way... 
brainrot overdoze, mixed with frustration...

 "wrld piss" operation was born.
an attempt to synergize with world peace.
an attempt to remind everyone how psyoped we are, letting twitter be our playground.

world peace for us on bitcoin.
wrld piss for those who don't.


"wrld piss" operation ended with minor success.
the messages that needed to be spoken were spoken.
two other individuals posted original content.
which was very nice of them. 
it was the only memes, someone other than me made.

at this point in time. 

no much paticipation. 
no much interaction.
zero trading. 

and im left with the most brutal, minimal, ugly shitposted collection.

i couldn't let it go.
i couldn't let it be so brutal.
the themes are indeed brutal and serious. 
thus the art is also brutal.
but to have it to the face like that.
i had to flower it,
 in something that will remind me the joy, hope and beauty of life.

give a happy and cute ending to the tale.

thus, in a stroke of irony, CyrtpoPkuns was born.
head to the left of the neck again.
cute and loveble. 
gentle beauty compared to the brutal nature of SIDS.

look deep enough, and u can hallucinate a body and arms to the pkuns.
they are not a face profile.
they are full body creatures.
with hands, and feet.
cute loveable creature companions to SIDS LOGOS.
well, atleast thats the way i see em.

the end.

ps. 
i am leaving out all the fantasy about non fungible runes. which never took flight.
and all other greed and gains fantasies i was bombarded psychologicaly with, 
along the active months of the project.

ps2. 
i never sold a piece. never got a single sat from anyone.
if you find my performace lacking, 
plz send your complains to the KOLs that dumped on you.

ps3.
just to cover one last base.
even though i didn't participate in CT nor any other social media.
i did participate on chain, 
and do cherish collections like pixogette and opium from early on.
