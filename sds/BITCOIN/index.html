Memories of TICKER:BITCOIN


============================================

the start.
q4 2021, if i recall correctly.
we be shitposting on biz.
bnb casino.

Harry Potter Obama Sonic 10 Ino 
wat a glourious dev
retard from the beyond
deploy contract , ticker : BITCOIN
WTF?

so much fucking keks,
a tornado of memes just flew over my house

tg opens
we gather
everybody working like retards
shitposting, organizing raids
applying to coin gecko, coin market cap, paprica 
making FOMO, holy shit 
"people searching bitcoin on coingecko gonna see us"

fud
fud 
fud
and then...

boom!!! coin gecko listing!!!
so many keks, memes
we took ticker BITCOIN
can u believe this shit...

do I really need to tell u?

i'm an iiiiiiiislaaaaand boy....  iykyk


i worked on website source a bit, just secraterial work.
the website was designed by i dont know who.
have no idea how they managed to make it so shitty.
was it a tiny bit better, i would have probably faded it.
it was a gem. still is.


i deployed a dumb nft collection 
made some memes

others did some devops, some secratary work
some actually put up dough for buying ads
we had online ads
and we had rikshas in india!!! wat!??
we had a retarded 30 sec commercial, which i see is still in use on thier profile


3 layers of chats by closeness to inner circle
toxic nsfw chat for the degens

shit was lit

we pumped like a rocket

and then..... we fucking had alt coins in our eco system
we were the pioneers of the absurd
the shitcoin of the shitcoins

we had a beef with
Bilbo Baggins Putin Charmander 9000 Inu 
TICKER: BINANCE

they made very beautiful hand drawn site
well, i exaggerate, it was all shit

they were the strongest team
and couple of other total abusrd bullshit tickers appeard also
like mushrooms after the rain

wow

i was there, with them for about 3 months i believe, maybe less.
it was rough, was forced to quit, not by anyone.
just the natural forces, consumed my life and i didn't know balance.

i haven't been in touch with them ever since.
and in last couple of months, i see how big they become.
how well they put the grind.
i solute them. 
it warms my heart to see them prosper.

espicially wen i see them at lepuppeteerfou's feed.
with a beatiful colorful wall in africa,
painted with their ugly sproto pfp collection,
with smiling niggers running, wearing shirts with the logo, 
water tanks with pfps grinning.

man, u upping the game.
based, as usual.
keeping it true to the spirit.


i kneel


wen somebody asks me where i learned to degen.
i tell em, BITCOIN.
